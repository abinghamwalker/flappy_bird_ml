This is just a simple follow along of a TechwithTim tutorial to look at NEAT (neuroevolution) in Python.  

It takes the simple game flappy bird and automates the task of playing the game with learning from this algorithm.

Once I have finished I may go into testing variables to investigate learning rates based on defaults used.
